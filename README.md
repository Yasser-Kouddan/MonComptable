This is a mobile application for supermarket inventory management developed using React Native, Expo, and Firebase. It allows supermarket owners or managers to track their inventory levels in real-time, store their suppliers contact and manage their stock easily.

This is my 2nd attempt building a full stack mobile app. I am not proud of this code base, as you can see the code is messy, there is no pure speration of interest only a shy try to implement it, the architecture of the project is also messy and no good use of the folder components. But it was necessary part of my learning process, i grew a lot while working on it as a react native dev and as a dev in generale, i learned to have a clear thinking process from the conception and design to the technologies used and architecture. 
i also learned the price of a messy code base, as after a 15 days of rest i had a hard time working with my own code!
