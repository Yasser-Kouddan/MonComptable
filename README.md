## Project Description

I am proud to present my project for creating a mobile application for supermarket inventory management, designed to simplify the lives of supermarket owners and managers. This application has been developed using cross-platform application development technologies, including React Native and Expo for the front end, and Firebase for the backend. The application offers a complete solution for monitoring real-time inventory levels, managing supplier contacts, and optimizing stock management.

This represents my second attempt at creating a full-stack mobile application. While I am not entirely satisfied with this codebase, it is clear that improvements are needed. The current code has shortcomings in terms of organization, with hesitant implementation and an unstructured project architecture. However, this step was essential in my learning journey. I have experienced significant growth as both a React Native developer and a developer overall.

This project has allowed me to gain a clearer perspective on the thought process, from initial design to technology choices to overall architecture. Additionally, I have learned to appreciate the value of a well-organized codebase, as it was challenging to work with my own code after a 15-day break.

I remain committed to continuously improving my development skills and creating higher-quality applications in the future.
